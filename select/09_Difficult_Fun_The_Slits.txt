He's lying by the river
He's rested and unsatisfied
He's searching for the better but finds that

Difficult fun is hard to come by
Difficult fun is hard to come by
And empty fun is easy
And empty fun is easy to find

Fun is not easy

He's lying around the gloam
He's rested and unsatisfied
Leaving a trail behind him
Fighting better on habits

Difficult fun is hard to come by
Difficult fun is hard to come by
And empty fun is easy
And empty fun is easy to find

Fun is not easy to find

Pleasure seeking
Pleasure seeking
Is easy
