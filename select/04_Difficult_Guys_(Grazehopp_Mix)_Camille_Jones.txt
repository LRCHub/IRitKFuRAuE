Ten times a day I wonder what is wrong with me
No time to waste I fall in love instantly
So go get the rope and tie my hands up real tight
Cause I need some help to keep me on a leash tonight
Cause I like it

[Chorus:]
I like the difficult guys
Ordinary girls know they shouldn't fall for
I like the opposite boys
But they don't like girls
I'm barking up the wrong tree

[Verse 2:]
Ten times a day I think I'm gonna loose my mind
I can't stop this (...) keep chasing all the wrong guys
So go get the gun, and hold it to my head real close
And just shot me down if I'm heading for a (...)
Cause I like it

[Chorus:]
I like the difficult guys
Ordinary girls know they shouldn't fall for
I like the opposite boys
But they don't like girls
I'm barking up the wrong tree
(X3)

I like the opposite boys (x2)

[Chorus:]
I like the difficult guys
Ordinary girls know they shouldn't fall for
I like the opposite boys
But they don't like girls
I'm barking up the wrong tree
